# New Days — Flavor & Events

Short: Adds flavor events, a handful of alternative ministers and decisions to support the "New Days" playset.

Installation:
1. Put the "New Days" folder inside your Hearts of Iron IV mod directory.
   - Windows: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod
2. Place `New Days.mod` in your mod root (same directory as other .mod files).
3. Launch HOI4 and enable "New Days - Flavor & Events" in the launcher.

Notes:
- This is a starter skeleton. I can generate sample focus trees, events, and localization next — tell me which countries or themes you want to target (e.g. small Baltic republics, a reorganized UK, alt-USA, pan-European union).
